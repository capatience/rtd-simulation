# CPOX-FT RTD Simulation

This python project simulates the residence-time distribution of gases in the CPOX FT reactor setup.
It considers three bodies with volumes V1, V2, and V3.
V1 corresponds to the volume of the upper section of the CPOX reactor, and V2 of lower section of the CPOX reactor.
V3 corresponds to the volume of the FT reactor.
